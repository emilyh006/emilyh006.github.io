## Research Experience



#### Graduate Research Assistant  
*IMPACT Lab* at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) | **2024 - Present**  
- Built web interfaces for online trait-rating studies, optimizing data collection and participant engagement.  
- Managed and analyzed data on rapid social judgments, focusing on perceptions of corruptibility in politicians based on facial cues.  



#### Undergraduate Research Assistant  
*VIU Lab* at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) | **2022 - 2023**  
- Recruited participants and collected data using psychophysical measures (eye tracking).  
- Trained research assistants on pre-screening, data collection, and troubleshooting experiments.  



#### Independent Projects  
**2022 - 2024**  
- Conducted two comprehensive research studies as part of academic coursework:  
  - *Replication Study: "How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character" (2024)*  
  - *Effect of Cultural Priming on Bicultural Individuals (2022)*  
- Managed the entire research process; including survey/web development, participant recruitment, data collection, statistical analysis, and presenting findings.

#### Supervised Research Projects  
- **Investigating the Generalizability and Mechanism of Corruptibility Perceptions** *(2024 - Present)*  
  - Explore perceived corruptibility of American politicians across cultures, races, and genders.  
  - **Methods/Techniques:** Developed web-based surveys using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; analyzed cross-cultural datasets using R, focusing on data cleaning and interpretation.  
- **A Preference to Look Closer to the Eyes is Associated with a Position-Invariant Face Neural Code** *(2022 - 2023)*  
  - Examined how gaze preferences influence face neural representations using eye-tracking data.  
  - **Methods/Techniques:** Collected gaze-contingent adaptation data through eye-tracking and MATLAB, and performed statistical analysis using R.  
<br>


#### Team Research Projects   
*2022 - 2024*  
- **Replication Study: "How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character"** 
  - Investigated moral judgments based on decision speed through a replication of Critcher et al. (2013).  
  - **Methods/Techniques:** Designed experiments using jsPsych, performed statistical analysis and data visualization in R, and developed web-based experimental platforms.  
- **Effect of Cultural Priming on Bicultural Individuals** 
  - Studied the impact of cultural priming on cognitive styles in bicultural individuals.  
  - **Methods/Techniques:** Designed surveys in Qualtrics, conducted participant recruitment through social media, and performed statistical analyses using R.
