## Research Experience



#### Graduate Research Assistant  
*IMPACT Lab* at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) | **2024 - Present**  
- Built web interfaces for online trait-rating studies, optimizing data collection and participant engagement.  
- Managed and analyzed data on rapid social judgments, focusing on perceptions of corruptibility in politicians based on facial cues.  

#### Undergraduate Research Assistant  
*VIU Lab* at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) | **2022 - 2023**  
- Recruited participants and collected data using psychophysical measures (eye tracking).  
- Trained research assistants on pre-screening, data collection, and troubleshooting experiments.  



#### Independent Projects  
**2022 - 2024**  
- Led two comprehensive research studies as part of academic coursework:  
  - *Replication Study: "How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character" (2024)*  
  - *Effect of Cultural Priming on Bicultural Individuals (2022)*  
- Managed the entire research process; including survey/web development, participant recruitment, data collection, statistical analysis, and presenting findings.

| **Development of Deep Learning Wrappers (Capstone Project)** <br> *2024 - Present* | Simplify the application of deep learning libraries in computational social science research with scalable wrappers and advanced data imputation methods.       | Machine learning library integration, workflow automation | Built scalable wrappers for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MLX; automated pre-processing workflows for tabular and non-tabular data.                    |
| **Investigating the Generalizability and Mechanism of Corruptibility Perceptions** <br> *2024 - Present* | Explored how facial features influence perceptions of corruptibility across cultural contexts.                                                     | Web development, Data analysis, Data cleaning | Created web-based surveys using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; analyzed cross-cultural datasets using R                                                      |
| **Replication Study: "How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character"** <br> *2024 - 2024* | Replicating Critcher et al. (2013) study on moral judgments based on decision speed.                                                            | Experimental design,  Web development, Data analysis | Designed experiments using jsPsych, and used R for analysis and visualization.                                                                           |
| **A Preference to Look Closer to the Eyes is Associated with a Position-Invariant Face Neural Cod** <br> *2022 - 2023* | Examined how fixation preferences on faces (eyes vs. mouth) influence neural representations and position invariance in face perception.          | Eye-tracking data collection, Data collection  | Collected and analyzed gaze-contingent adaptation data through eye tracking to study neural mechanisms.                                                                |
| **Effect of Cultural Priming on Bicultural Individuals** <br> *2022 - 2023* | Investigated cognitive styles (holistic vs. analytical) influenced by individualistic and collectivistic cultural primes among bicultural people. | Experimental design, statistical analysis (R)     | Designed surveys in Qualtrics and performed statistical analyses using R                                                                  |
