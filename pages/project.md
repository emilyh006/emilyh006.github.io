### Development of Deep Learning Wrappers  
*2024 - Present*  

This project aims to build scalable, and reliable wrappers to simplify the use of deep learning libraries—such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flux, and MLX—in computational and applied social sciences. The project focuses on automating pre-processing for both tabular and non-tabular data, enabling broader accessibility and efficiency for researchers exploring complex social phenomena through machine learning.

### Investigating the generalizability and mechanism of the association between corruptible look and corruption record

*2024 - Present* | [OSF]()

This study seeks to examine whether the perceived corruptibility of politicians' faces, as shown to predict real-world corruption convictions, is influenced by shared cultural context between perceivers and politicians. I developed the web interface and survey for the study, facilitated data collection, and processed the data to explore associations between facial features and perceived corruptibility across cultural contexts.

### Replication Study of “How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character” by Critcher et al. (2013)  
*2024 - Present* | [Github](https://github.com/ucsd-psych201a/critcher2013_3)

This project aims to replicate Critcher et al.(2013)'s influential study on moral decision and , which explored how people's judgement on others is influenced by the decision speed and. Using an experimental design and computational analysis, it explores how rapid decisions may reveal people's social judgement of other's underlying moral character.

### A Preference to Look Closer to the Eyes is Associated with a Position-Invariant Face Neural Code
*2022 - 2023* | [OSF](https://osf.io/t795b/) |  [Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-023-02412-0)

This study, led by Dr. Puneeth N. Chakravarthula and Dr. Miguel P. Eckstein, examined how differences in preferred fixation locations on faces (eyes vs. mouth) influence neural representations using a gaze-contingent face adaptation aftereffect paradigm. My role in the project involved contributing to data collection to investigate spatial transfer of face adaptation effects and its implications for neural tuning and position invariance in face perception.

### Effect of Cultural Priming: Information Processing and Social Perception Among Bicultural Individuals   
*2022 - 2023*  

This study examined the influence of cultural primes (individualistic vs. collectivistic) on social attribution and information processing styles (holistic vs. analytical) in monocultural and bicultural individuals. As part of this academic project, I led the team in designing the experiment, recruiting participants, processing data, and performing statistical analyses to investigate variations in cognitive processes influenced by cultural background.
