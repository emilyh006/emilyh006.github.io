### DeepVerse: Development of Deep Learning Wrappers  
*2024 - Present* 

The DeepVerse series bridges deep learning tools and social sciences by creating scalable, user-friendly wrappers for popular libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flux, and MLX. These wrappers streamline complex processes, automating tasks like preprocessing tabular and non-tabular data, and making machine learning tools more accessible for social science researchers.    

These series focus on enabling researchers to explore complex social phenomena through efficient and user-friendly software that is entirely open-source and free to use. By automating key processes, we aim to broaden accessibility and empower social scientists with the tools they need to conduct impactful research.  

Currently, we are developing *DeepComplete*, a library designed to impute missing data using autoencoders and adversarial neural networks. This innovative method outperforms traditional imputation tools in precision and flexibility, making it suitable for a wider range of applications.

### Investigating the generalizability and mechanism of the association between corruptible look and corruption record

*2024 - Present* | [OSF]()

The project includes a series of studies examining whether judgments of perceived corruptibility—previously shown to predict real-world corruption convictions—are consistent across cultural contexts, as well as across the race and gender of politicians. By investigating these factors, we seeks to determine the extent to which these perceptions are generalizable across diverse populations and identity-based characteristics.

As part of this project, I developed a web interface tailored to the study’s requirements, ensuring smooth and user-friendly navigation for participants. In addition, I facilitated data collection and processed the data to explore associations between facial features and perceived corruptibility across cultural contexts.

### Replication Study of “How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character” by Critcher et al. (2013)  
*2024 - 2024* | [Github](https://github.com/ucsd-psych201a/critcher2013_3)

This project replicated Critcher et al. (2013)'s influential study on moral decision-making, which explored how people's moral judgments of others are influenced by decision speed. Using an experimental design, we successfully reproduced the original findings, demonstrating that decision speed can reveal social judgments about others' underlying moral character.

My role in this project included designing and deploying the web-based survey to collect participant responses, facilitating data collection, wrangling and analysis. I ensured the survey mirrored the original study's structure while being accessible and intuitive for participants.

### A Preference to Look Closer to the Eyes is Associated with a Position-Invariant Face Neural Code
*2022 - 2023* | [OSF](https://osf.io/t795b/) |  [Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-023-02412-0)

This study, led by Dr. Puneeth N. Chakravarthula and Dr. Miguel P. Eckstein, examined how differences in preferred fixation locations on faces (e.g., closer to the eyes or mouth) relate to neural representations of faces. "Upper lookers" (those who fixate near the eyes) showed partial spatial transfer of face adaptation effects (FAE), suggesting position-invariant neural tuning, where facial information is encoded flexibly across spatial positions. In contrast, "lower lookers" (those who fixate near the mouth) showed no such transfer, indicating more position-dependent encoding.

My contributions to this project included recruiting participants, running them through the experimental setup, monitoring eye movements using psychophysical measures (eye tracking), and ensuring data accuracy. I also trained research assistants on pre-screening, data collection protocols, and troubleshooting experimental issues.

### Effect of Cultural Priming: Information Processing and Social Perception Among Bicultural Individuals   
*2022 - 2023*  

This study examined the influence of cultural primes (individualistic vs. collectivistic) on social attribution and information processing styles (holistic vs. analytical) in monocultural and bicultural individuals. 

As part of this academic project, I led the team in designing the experiment, recruiting participants, processing data, and performing statistical analyses to investigate variations in cognitive processes influenced by cultural background.
