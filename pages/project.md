### Development of Deep Learning Wrappers  
**Timeline:** 2024 - Present  
Building fast, scalable, and reliable wrappers to simplify the use of deep learning libraries—such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flux, and MLX—in computational and applied social sciences. The project focuses on automating pre-processing for both tabular and non-tabular data, enabling broader accessibility and efficiency for researchers exploring complex social phenomena through machine learning.

### Replication Study of “How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character” by Critcher et al. (2013)  
**Timeline:** 2024 - Present  
This project aims to replicate Critcher et al.(2013)'s influential study on moral decision and , which explored how people's judgement on others is influenced by the decision speed and. Using an experimental design and computational analysis, it explores how rapid decisions may reveal people's social judgement of other's underlying moral character.

### Independent Research Project: Cultural Background and Cognitive Processing Styles  
**Timeline:** 2022 - 2023  
Investigated how cultural factors influence cognitive processing styles, such as holistic vs. analytical thinking, through psychometric assessments and behavioral experiments. This research highlighted the impact of cultural background of individuals' in approaches to information processing and attention, particularly within social cognition and perceptual tasks.
